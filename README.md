# Schematic and PCB liblaries for Altium
This is an **open-source** project for my fellow electronic engineers. I have collected every component I created for my projects. You can freely use these libraries for your project without beginning from scratch. If you want to contribute to this project send me a message to add you as a collaborator.

## Check List for component creation
***For Schematic Symbol***

 - [ ] Find the component from the manufactures site.
 - [ ] Check supply status and read the datasheet.
 - [ ] Update the **Designator** and **Comment** sections.
 - [ ] Rename the pins correctly.
 - [ ] Organize and group the pins for easier use.

***For PCB footprint***

 - [ ] Make sure pad sizes are slightly bigger than pins.
 - [ ] Check the clearance between pads.
 - [ ] Organize the Overlay Layers (Keep it neat)
 - [ ] Add the Assembly notes (Mechanical 24)
 - [ ] Add the 3D Model (Mechanical 1)
 - [ ] Add Keep out region (Keep out Layer)
 - [ ] Add **.Designator** thing (in Assembly Notes)
 - [ ] Mark the 1st Pin on assembly notes and overlay layers.
 - [ ] Double check PIN numbers and correct overlapping of the 3D model

***Final Checks for Both Footprint and Symbol***

 - [ ] Double check pins numbers .
 - [ ] Add the footprint for the schematic symbol.
